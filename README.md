Hello Reader, 

My name is Enrique and I’m gonna run a marathon. 
So I created an algorithm to help me do that. 

A marathon takes the average JOE 4 to 5 hours to finish. 
It will  probably take ME closer to 6  but for the sake of my dignity we’ll say 5. 

Naturally I’ve created a Perfectly Crafted Playlist to listen to. 
However,  Marathon training takes 4-6 months  so I’ve grown tired of my perfectly crafted playlist.
I have tried randomizing the songs but that doesn’t work for me because I like to  start with rythms like Tchaikovsky or Ron Pope. Order matters to me. 

I've tried other runners' lists but I don’t like their songs. 
I’ve tried the recommended spotify lists and let's just say that I’m not a 5-hours-straight-of-hardcore-EDM kind of guy.

So I've created Marmpy, an algorithm that produces playlists with songs I like, in the right order during my run, and songs that make me feel motivated. All of this based on my originally perfectly crafted playlist.
